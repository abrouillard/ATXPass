									<h5 class="faq-question">Can I share my pass or sell it?</h5>
									<p class="faq-answer">All ATX Passes are non-transferrable.</p>
									<h5 class="faq-question">What happens if the tour or activity is cancelled due to bad weather or other
										problems?</h5>
									<p class="faq-answer">Should the tour or activity provider cancel the event for any reason, you have the
										opportunity to reschedule the same event during your selected ATX Pass days. If rescheduling is not possible
										for any reason, you have the option of choosing from more than 20 other activities or receiving a refund if
										you choose not to use the ATX Pass as a result of the cancelled activity.</p>
									<h5 class="faq-question">Do you offer additional discounts for seniors, military, students or groups?</h5>

										given.</p>
									<h5 class="faq-question">Do I receive a paper copy of the pass?</h5>

										are delivered via SMS and email. Providing correct mobile phone and email address information is essential to
										guarantee your bookings.</p>
									<h5 class="faq-question">I haven’t received my ATX Pass via SMS or email. What should I do?</h5>
